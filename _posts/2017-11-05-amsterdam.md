### Description

Our second ClojureBridge workshop in Amsterdam is planned!!!
The purpose of our workshops is to provide a safe and inclusive environment to anyone that wants to learn programming or improve her/his programming skills.
The workshop is free and taught by a number of volunteers (a small contribution might be asked for lunch). We use Clojure which is a general purpose programming language and we very much enjoy working with.

Looking forward to seeing you all!
