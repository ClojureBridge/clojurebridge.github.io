**Venue:** hub:raum, Przemysłowa 12, Kraków

We're aiming the event at women who are new to programming. The mentors are experienced developers, but perhaps not Clojure experts – we'll all be learning.

**Friday 2nd December**<br/>
18.00 - 19:30    Installation party - Meet your team,  & let's install Clojure on your computer.<br/>
<br/>
**Saturday 3rd December**<br/>
9:00 - 10:00    Warm up - Meet other teams over coffee, make sure your computer is ready for code<br/>
10:00 - 10:15    Welcome message<br/>
10:15 - 13:00    Workshops part 1 - Get cracking with your code!<br/>
13:00 - 14:00    Lunch<br/>
14:00 - 14:45    TBA<br/>
14:45 - 17:30    Workshops part 2 - Learn some more!<br/>
21:00    Afterparty<br/>

Everyone is welcome – sponsors, boyfriends, girlfriends and developers that happen to be in the neighborhood can all be a part of the community.

The FAQ:

- What should I know before the workshops?<br/>
You should be able to understand the application form and have a basic knowledge about working with a computer (knowing only Windows, internet browser & Office is just fine). You should also take a look at the code of conduct that we'll enforce during the event: http://berlincodeofconduct.org/

- How much does the workshop cost? <br/>
It's free! You just need to bring your laptop and a fresh head.

- Who are these workshops for?<br/>
ClojureBridge aims to increase diversity in information technology industry.
We focus at underrepresented groups by offering free, beginner-friendly programming workshops in many cities around the globe.

- Will the event be conducted in English?<br/>
No, group work will be in Polish. If you'd rather speak English, let us know in the form – we might be able to arrange an English-speaking mentor for you.

- Can men attend? <br/>
They can apply, but should bear in mind that women will be given a priority.

- I'm a programmer already, is there a way to help you?<br/>
Yes! Shoot us an email at clojurebridgekrakow@gmail.com
