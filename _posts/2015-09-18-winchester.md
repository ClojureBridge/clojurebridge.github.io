This workshop is intended to reach out to women who are new to computer programming and/or the Clojure programming language. To register, you must identify as a woman. Men, you are welcome to come if you find a woman who wants to learn Clojure who will register and bring you as a guest.

Clojure is a general purpose programming language. It encourages functional programming, is well suited to multi-core machines (where the future is going), and requires very little code to express yourself. It has a strong focus on simplicity and building elegant solutions to problems. It runs on the server/desktop, and in the browser.

In this workshop, we'll teach the basics of the Clojure programming language and work on building an application in Clojure. We'll meet up Friday night to install all of the software you need, and then spend Saturday learning and writing code.

Total programming novices, system administrators, developers in other languages, and folks who attended our previous workshops or similar workshops like RailsBridge are all welcome. As appropriate we'll have different classes separated by experience level. Each participant needs to bring his or her own computer.

When you RSVP you'll be asked a few question about your operating system, level and type of programming experience, and whether you will require childcare. Childcare and private space for nursing or pumping may be made available if there is interest -- just let us know.

(Sometimes people ask if the Friday night InstallFest is mandatory, and yes, it is! It's a crucial part of the weekend, even if you’ve already gone through the instructions independently. There are a ton of moving parts when setting up a development environment, and the reason that we’re able to get through the curriculum on Saturday is that every single student has had their dev environment checked and has been awarded a sticker for their successes. There are also enough changing parts that even if you’ve been to a workshop in the past, you should attend the Installfest to get re-verified, because this stuff changes almost constantly. If you would like to attend the workshop but attending the InstallFest would pose a difficulty due to travel or other limitations, please [contact an organizer](mailto:clojurebridgeky@gmail.com) directly to discuss options.)

We are looking for additional volunteers, both folks who know Clojure (or experienced programmers who would like to learn some Clojure) to TA and people who are willing to help with logistics. Please [apply here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/18VtkWTvwgMiPfJod6k50OV51AlwvQw5ej1UplyJKeJ4/viewform?usp=send_form) to volunteer or [email an organizer](mailto:clojurebridgeky@gmail.com) for more information.

If you have questions or ideas for us, the best way to get in touch is to [email an organizer](mailto:clojurebridgeky@gmail.com).
