In this workshop, we'll take you through building a sample app using
Clojure. We'll meet up Friday night to install all of the software you
need, and then spend Saturday learning and writing code. Each
participant needs to bring her or his own computer with fairly recent
Mac, Linux or Windows installation. If you have questions about your
hardware, email one of the organizers before the event!

When you RSVP you'll be asked a few questions about your operating
system, level and type of programming experience.

Sometimes people ask if the Friday night Installfest is mandatory, and
yes, it is! It's a crucial part of the weekend, even if you’ve already
gone through the instructions independently. There are a ton of moving
parts when setting up a development environment, and the reason that
we’re able to get through the curriculum on Saturday is that every
single student has had their dev environment checked and has been
awarded a sticker for their successes.

### Who Should Attend?

ClojureBridge is open to women and all trans*, genderqueer, and gender
non-conforming people.

We'll have dinner and beverages on Friday evening, and breakfast and
lunch on Saturday. If you have any dietary restrictions, please note
these when you register for the workshop.

If you have questions or ideas for us, the best way to get in touch is
to email or tweet at the organizers.
