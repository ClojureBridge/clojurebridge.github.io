This free workshop will be hosted by Puppet Labs and Simple in Portland, Oregon. This workshop is open to anyone who identifies as a woman, genderqueer, genderfluid, or genderfree regardless of gender presentation or assigned sex at birth. It is suitable for complete beginner to intermediate programmers who have no previous experience of the Clojure programming language.

In this workshop, we'll take you through building a sample app using Clojure. We'll meet up Friday night at the Simple offices in the Pearl to install all of the software you need, and then spend Saturday at the Puppet Labs offices in SW learning and writing code. There will be dinner provided at the Friday installfest, and breakfast and lunch provided at the Saturday workshop. Each participant needs to bring their own computer with fairly recent Mac, Linux or Windows installation. If you have questions about your hardware, email one of the organizers before the event!

We will be hosting the Installfest Friday, April 17 at the Simple office, 926 NW 13th Ave Suite 200, Portland, OR 97209. The workshop itself will be hosted at Puppet Labs on Saturday, April 18, 308 SW 2nd Ave, Fifth Floor, Portland, OR 97204.
