ClojureBridge aims to increase diversity within the Clojure community by offering free, beginner-friendly Clojure programming workshops for women. ClojureBridge Helsinki takes place on 16th and 17th May in Lasipalatsi.

ClojureBridge is free of charge and is aimed at people who identify as a woman. Men, you are welcome to come if you find a woman who wants to learn Clojure who will register and bring you as a guest. In that case, choose "normal ticket + avec" from registration below.  Due to limitations with space, tickets with _avec-options_ are limited.

The course is divided in two sections
1. Installfest on Saturday 16th of May at 12.00
2. The actual workshop on Sunday 17th May between 10am and 5pm (10:00-17:00)

Lunch will be provided for all registered participants.  Please let us know of any possible dietary restrictions.
