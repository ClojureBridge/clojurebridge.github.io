This workshop is intended to reach out to women who are new to Clojure. To register, you must identify as a woman. Men, you are welcome to come if you find a woman who wants to learn Clojure who will register and bring you as a guest.

In this workshop, we'll take you through building a sample app using Clojure. We'll meet up Friday night (see Additional Info below for details) to install all of the software you need, and then spend the workshop day learning and writing code.

Total programming novices, system administrators, developers in other languages are all welcome. Each participant needs to bring his or her own computer, a relatively up-to-date Mac, Linux or Windows computer.

Attendees must RSVP through the  [Meetup event page](http://www.meetup.com/Clojure-Ireland/events/225087978/).

(Sometimes people ask if the Friday night installfest is mandatory, and yes, it is! It's a crucial part of the weekend, even if you’ve already gone through the instructions independently. There are a ton of moving parts when setting up a development environment, and the reason that we’re able to get through the curriculum on Saturday is that every single student has had their dev environment checked and has been awarded a sticker for their successes. There are also enough changing parts that even if you’ve been to a workshop in the past, you should attend the Installfest to get re-verified, because this stuff changes almost constantly.)

If you have questions or ideas for us, or want to volunteer, the best way to get in touch is to email Kevin Noonan and Claudia Doppioslash or comment on the [Meetup event page](http://www.meetup.com/Clojure-Ireland/events/225087978/).
