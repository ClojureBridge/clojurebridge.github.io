Clojure is an expressive, far-reaching and fast programming language. It targets the JVM and JavaScript, meaning that you can write server-side, web and even mobile apps with it. You can also [boil eggs](http://blog.eikeland.se/2014/10/06/pid-transducer/). Clojure is well represented in the job market and used by start-ups as well as giants like Amazon, Netflix, Facebook, Twitter, Spotify and Soundcloud.

### Who is this for?
This workshop is for women who are new to Clojure or new to programming. If you identify as a woman and are interesting in learning more, please register and join us. Men are welcome, too! But, if you’re male and would like to attend, you’ll need to find a woman who wants to learn Clojure who will register and bring you along as a guest.

Each participant needs to bring her or his own computer with fairly recent Mac, Linux or Windows installation. If you have questions about your hardware, email one of the organizers before the event!

### What will we make?
**Beginners** - introduce concepts around Clojure and make a drawing program.

We'll meet up Friday night (see Additional Info below for details) to install all of the software you need, and then spend the workshop day learning and writing code.

When you RSVP you'll be asked a few questions about your operating system, level and type of programming experience.

(Sometimes people ask if the Friday night installfest is mandatory, and yes, it is! It's a crucial part of the weekend, even if you’ve already gone through the instructions independently. There are a ton of moving parts when setting up a development environment, and the reason that we’re able to get through the curriculum on Saturday is that every single student has had their dev environment checked and has been awarded a sticker for their successes.)

* The InstallFest is November 20, food and refreshments will be available at 18:30, we'll start at 19:00 and last roughly 2 hours.
* The Workshop is November 21, starting from 10AM, ending approximately after 5PM
* There'll be an after workshop bar with drinks
* ClojureBridge is free-of-charge
