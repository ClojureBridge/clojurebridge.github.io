ClojureBridge is a beginner-friendly Clojure programming workshop for under-represented groups in tech.

You will learn fundamental programming concepts in Clojure through practical examples and exercises. Teachers and assistants will be there to guide you and help you build your first apps in Clojure.

The workshop is open to people who are completely new to programming, as well as existing developers new to Clojure.

### Who can attend?

ClojureBridge is primarily intended for participants who identify as female, transgender, or non-binary with an interest in learning programming, and also functional programming with Clojure.

Men are welcome, but only as guest to a woman or non-binary individual who would like to attend.

ClojureBridge is emphatically queer and trans-friendly.
