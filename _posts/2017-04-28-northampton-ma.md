**Venue:**<br/>
Ford Hall 240, 100 Green Street, Northampton, MA<br/>
Smith College<br/>

ClojureBridge is a free 1-day workshop aimed at increasing the participation of women in the Clojure community. It will be held at Smith College, on Saturday April 29th, 2017 with a required installfest on Friday April 28th, 2017 in the evening. The workshop is intended both for those new to programming, as well as those with some programming experience who would like to explore programming using Clojure, a modern functional programming language.

The workshop will introduce you to fundamental programming concepts and approaches. Participants will fill out a quick survey to help us create groups based on prior knowledge and understanding. Although participants can install the required software for the workshop on their own, it is recommended everyone attend on Friday to set up their programming environment. Saturday will be spent learning and practicing Clojure programming. You will be working in small groups of 4 to 6 attendees each. Each participant needs to bring a laptop computer with a fairly recent operating system (Mac, Linux or Windows). If you have questions about your hardware or you don’t have a laptop, please don’t hesitate to send an email to the organizers before the event.
