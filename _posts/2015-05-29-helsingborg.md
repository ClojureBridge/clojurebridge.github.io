ClojureBridge aims to increase diversity within the programming community by offering free, beginner-friendly programming workshops for women.

This ClojureBridge workshop will be held in Helsingborg, Sweden and is intended for those with none or some programming experience. We will use Clojure, a modern programming language running on the Java virtual machine, to introduce you to fundamental programming concepts. You will learn and practice in small groups of 2 to 4 attendees each. To register, you must identify as a woman. Men, you are welcome to come if you find a woman who wants to learn Clojure, and who will register and bring you as a guest.

In this workshop, we'll take you through building a sample app using Clojure. We'll meet up Friday night at Mindpark in the Helsingborg Campus to install all of the software you need. Then we will spend Saturday, also at Mindpark, learning and writing code. There will be dinner provided at the Friday installfest, and breakfast and lunch provided at the Saturday workshop. You are welcome to stay for drinks after the workshop on Saturday evening.

Each participant needs to bring their own computer with a fairly recent Mac, Linux or Windows installation. If you have questions about your hardware, email one of the organizers before the event! The workshop will be held in Swedish, unless English is requested.
