### Description

ClojureBridge is a free 1-day workshop aimed at increasing the participation
of women in the Clojure community. It will be held in Stockholm, on Saturday
May 6th, 2017 with an install fest on Friday May 5th, 2017 in the evening.
The workshop is intended both for those new to programming, as well as those
with some programming experience who would like to explore programming using
Clojure, a modern functional programming language. If you have a lot of
programming experience, you may find the pace a bit slow; consider joining
us as a coach! :)

The workshop will introduce you to fundamental programming concepts and
approaches. Participants will fill out a quick survey to help us create groups
based on prior knowledge and understanding. Although participants can install
the required software for the workshop on their own, it is recommended everyone
attend on Friday to set up her programming environment. Saturday will be spent
learning and practising Clojure programming. You will be working in small
groups of around 3 attendees each. Each participant needs to bring a laptop
computer with a fairly recent operating system (Mac, Linux or Windows). If you
have questions about your hardware or you don’t have a laptop, please don’t
hesitate to send an email to the organisers before the event.

The workshop will be held in English, but we will have a few Swedish speakers
on hand, as well.

### Contact us

We're on Twitter at [ClojureBridgeSE](https://twitter.com/ClojureBridgeSE).

### Who can attend?

The workshop is open to all women, trans*, and gender nonconforming people.

### Code of Conduct

The workshop provides a safe and welcoming environment for everyone,
so we will be asking all learners and event volunteers to respect our
[Code of Conduct](http://bridgefoundry.org/code-of-conduct/), which will be
strictly enforced. Our aim is that ClojureBridge Stockholm will introduce
learners to new possibilities in programming and grow the tech community
into a more diverse and interesting group.
