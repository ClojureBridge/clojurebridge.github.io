ClojureBridge is a beginner-friendly Clojure programming workshop for women.

In this workshop, we'll take you through building a sample app using Clojure. We'll meet up Friday night to install all of the software you need, and then spend Saturday learning and writing code. Each participant needs to bring her or his own computer with fairly recent Mac, Linux or Windows installation. If you have questions about your hardware, email one of the organizers before the event!

Food: We're providing dinner on Friday evening, breakfast and lunch on Saturday. Please email Jen Eliuk if you have any dietary restrictions.

Attendees must RSVP through the [Meetup event page](http://www.meetup.com/denofclojure/events/223178078/), as spaces are limited. ClojureBridge is dedicated to increasing diversity in the Clojure community, men are welcome as the guest of a woman who would like to attend. ClojureBridge is emphatically queer and trans friendly.

Each participant needs to bring her or his own computer with fairly recent Mac, Linux or Windows installation. Parking is not provided but there are various lots and the venue is very close to Union Station if you're using public transportation.
