### Description
ClojureBridge is a beginner-friendly Clojure programming workshop for women.

You’ll learn fundamental programming concepts in Clojure through practical examples and exercises. Teachers and assistants are there to guide you and help you build your first apps in Clojure.

The workshop is open to people who are completely new to programming, through to existing developers new to Clojure. We organize attendees into small groups with at least one teacher and one assistant.
