### Description
ClojureBridge is a beginner-friendly Clojure programming workshop for women. As a community initiative, the workshop is free of cost.

This is the 2nd edition of ClojureBridge Bangalore. The last one in March'19 had folks from varied programming; even non-programming backgrounds. This time around we'll split into groups of Beginner and Intermediate. The intermediate group will have more challenging exercises to delve into.

You will learn fundamental programming concepts in Clojure through practical examples and exercises. Teachers and assistants will be there to guide you and help you build your first apps in Clojure.

The workshop is open to people who are completely new to programming, as well as existing developers new to Clojure. We organize attendees into small groups with at least one teacher and one assistant.

Attendees must RSVP through the Meetup event page, as spaces are limited.

‚ùóÔ∏èIMPORTANT: ClojureBridge is dedicated to increasing diversity in the Clojure community ‚Äì men are welcome, but only as the guest of a woman who would like to attend. ClojureBridge is emphatically queer and trans-friendly.

### Additional Info
üóìEvent Schedule

Friday 11th October, 6.30pm - 8pm: An overview of Clojure, demos and support setting up a Clojure development environment on your laptop.

Saturday 12th October, 10.30am - 5:30pm: Work through the Clojure concepts and carry out coding exercises in small groups.

It is essential to attend the Friday evening session if you wish to attend the workshop the next day. This prevents delays for other attendees during the workshop.

üíªPlease bring your own laptop for the workshop.
