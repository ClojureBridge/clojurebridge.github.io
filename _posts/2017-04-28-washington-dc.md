**Venue:**<br/>
Blackstone Technology Group,<br/>
1110 N Glebe Rd. #200<br/>
Arlington, VA 22201<br/>

In this workshop, we'll be introducing participants to programming in Clojure. We'll meet up Friday night to install all of the software you need, and then spend workshop day learning and writing code.

Total programming novices, system administrators, and developers in other languages are all welcome. Depending on turn out, we hope to have different classes separated by experience level. Each participant needs to bring his or her own computer.

When you RSVP you'll be asked a few question about your operating system, level and type of programming experience.

(Sometimes people ask if the Friday night installfest is mandatory, and yes, it is! It's a crucial part of the weekend, even if you’ve already gone through the instructions independently. There are a ton of moving parts when setting up a development environment, and the reason that we’re able to get through the curriculum on Saturday is that every single student has had their dev environment checked and has been awarded a sticker for their successes. There are also enough changing parts that even if you’ve been to a workshop in the past, you should attend the Installfest to get re-verified, because this stuff changes almost constantly.)

We are looking for additional volunteers, both folks who know Clojure to TA and people who are willing to help with logistics. Please sign up here: http://www.signupgenius.com/go/5080f4eadac2ea1f94-clojurebridge

If you have questions or ideas for us, the best way to get in touch is to email the organizer.

You will need your own computer for this event. If you do not have a computer available, please contact the organizers, as we may be able to arrange to lend a computer.

Public transport is preferred, as there is limited street parking. The nearest Metro station is Ballston, and is an 8 minute walk. Buses stop nearby.
