**Venue:**<br/>
CircleCI<br/>
201 Spear Street<br/>
12th Floor<br/>
San Francisco, CA 94105<br/>

This workshop is for women interested in learning to program with Clojure, an expressive, general-purpose programming language.

People who identify as men are welcome to come and learn so long as they are guests of an attendee who does not identify as a man. ClojureBridge is emphatically queer and trans* friendly.
This is an introductory workshop. The focus is on those new to programming. Complete beginners are welcome! (If you have experience programming in another language and would like to learn Clojure, you may find the pace of the workshop slow.)

This workshop introduces data structures and functions, and provides opportunities to use them to create programs. We'll meet up on Friday to install all of the software you need, then spend Saturday learning and writing code.

**Schedule**

* InstallFest: Friday, December 15, 6:00pm–9:00pm
* Workshop: Saturday, December 16, 10:00am–5:00pm

The InstallFest on Friday is a time to get some help setting up a working Clojure development environment. If you'd prefer to set up your environment on your own you can skip that and work through the setup documentation on your own.

You do not need to be at the whole InstallFest - drop in for an hour any time before 6 PM and 9 PM to get set up!

Please do show up on time on Saturday.

**Prerequisites**

* A reasonably up-to-date laptop running OS X or Windows
* A power cord
* A little patience
* A little curiosity
