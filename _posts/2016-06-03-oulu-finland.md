ClojureBridge is a free programming workshop for those who identify as women, with the aim of increasing diversity within the programming community. The workshop lasts for two days, and during the workshop you'll work through a set of exercises with the help of our awesome coaches. No prior programming knowledge required! All you need is your own laptop.

The event kicks off with an installation party on the 3rd of June (3.6.), and on Saturday 4th of June (4.6.) we'll have the main workshop. The venue is Solita's new office in the city centre, near Toripakka.

The registration will open on the 16th of May (16.5.). We'll have room for approximately 25 attendees, this number being dependent on, for example, how many coaches we get. When you register, please tell us something about yourself and your programming experience. If we get a lot of registrees, we'll try to select applicants with similar levels of experience. We'll also pay attention to the day that you registered, so that people who register on Monday have a better chance of getting a spot than people who register on Tuesday. We feel like this is fair to everyone, and still gives us the ability to select attendees with similar amounts of prior programming knowledge.

More information will be available closer to the event.
