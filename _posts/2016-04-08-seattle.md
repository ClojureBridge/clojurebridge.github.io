In this workshop, we'll introduce you to the fundamentals of the Clojure programming language. We'll meet up Friday night to install all of the software you need, and then spend Saturday learning and writing code.

This event is intentionally timed to be the weekend before the big west coast Clojure conference (Clojure/West), which is also being held here in Seattle.
