### Description

ClojureBridge is a free, beginner-friendly workshop teaching the Clojure programming language, primarily aimed at those who identify as women, transgender & non-binary. ClojureBridge is emphatically queer and trans* friendly.

You’ll learn fundamental programming concepts in Clojure through practical examples and exercises. Teachers and assistants are there to guide you and help you build your first apps in Clojure.

The workshop is open to people who are completely new to programming, through to existing developers new to Clojure. We organise attendees into small groups with at least one teacher and one assistant.

Priority is given to those who identify as women, transgender and/or non-binary. Men may register as a guest of one of these participants.

### Additional Info

Event Schedule

* Friday 2 March, 6.30pm - 9pm: we ensure you have a working development environment and give a general introduction to what you can do with Clojure.

* Saturday 3 March, 10.00am - 5:30pm: we’ll work through the Clojure concepts and carry out coding exercises in small groups.

It's essential to attend the Friday evening session if you wish to attend the workshop the next day. This prevents delays for other attendees during the workshop.
