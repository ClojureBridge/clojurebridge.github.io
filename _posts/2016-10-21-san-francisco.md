**Venue:** CircleCI, 201 Spear St, San Francisco 94105<br/>
<br/>
ClojureBridge, a free 1-day workshop aimed at increasing the participation of women in the Clojure community, will be held in San Francisco on Saturday October 22 2016 with an optional install fest on Friday October 21 2016 in the late afternoon. The workshop is intended both for those new to programming, as well as those with some programming experience, who would like to explore programming using Clojure, a modern functional programming language.

The workshop will introduce you to fundamental programming concepts and approaches. Participants can choose between two tracks, based on their programming experience. Participants can install the required software for the workshop by themselves. For those who would like help or prefer to to install software as a group, we will meet Friday late afternoon to install all of the software. Saturday will be spent learning and practicing Clojure programming. You will be working in small groups of 2 to 4 attendees each. Each participant needs to bring a laptop computer with a fairly recent operating system (Mac, Linux or Windows). If you have questions about your hardware or you don’t have a laptop, don’t hesitate to send an email to the organizers before the event.

#### Who can to attend?

The workshop is open to all women, trans*, and gender nonconforming people. Men are welcome if they are an invited guest of a student who qualifies by the above definition. Attendees inviting a guest should select quantity 2 when signing up for tickets, and fill out their guest's information in the 2nd ticket.

#### Code of Conduct:

The workshop provides a safe and welcoming environment for everyone, so we will be asking all learners and event volunteers to respect our Code of Conduct ( http://bridgefoundry.org/code-of-conduct/ ), which will be strictly enforced. Our aim is that ClojureBridge San Francisco will introduce learners to new possibilities in programming and make the tech community in the Bay Area a more diverse and interesting place.
