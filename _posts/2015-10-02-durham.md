This workshop is intended to reach out to women who are new to Clojure programming language.
If she is interested in learning Clojure, total programming novices, system administrators, developers in other languages, and folks who attended our previous workshops are all welcome. We'll have 5-7 different groups separated by programming background/experience level. Each participant needs to bring her own computer.

When you RSVP you'll be asked a few question about your operating system, such as level and type of programming experience.

Sometimes people ask if the Friday night installfest is mandatory, and yes, it is! It's a crucial part of the weekend, even if you’ve already gone through the instructions independently. There are a ton of moving parts when setting up a development environment, and the reason that we’re able to get through the curriculum on Saturday is that every single student has had their dev environment checked and has been awarded a sticker for their successes. There are also enough changing parts that even if you’ve been to a workshop in the past, you should attend the Installfest to get re-verified, because this stuff changes almost constantly.

If you have questions or ideas for us, go to https://groups.google.com/d/forum/clojurebridge-durham-2015.

- Bring a reasonably up-to-date laptop running OS X, Linux or Windows.
- Make sure you can install software downloaded from internet. (you will install a couple of software in your laptop.)
- Double check the location http://www.meetup.com/TriClojure/photos/25731083/
- Park your car on the S Roxboro St side parking lot. If this lot is full, you may use E Pettigrew St side parking lot.
- Save the time for After Party
