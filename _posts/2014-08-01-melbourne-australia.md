This workshop is intended to reach out to women who are interested in learning programming with Clojure.  Men are welcome to come if you find a woman who wants to learn Clojure and come together.   ClojureBridge is emphatically queer and trans friendly.

In this workshop, we'll take you through building a complete web application from scratch using Clojure.  By the end of the workshop, you'll have an application on the internet that connects to the World Bank Indicators API and reads, analyzes, and displays interesting information.  We'll meet up on Friday to install all of the software you need, and then spend Saturday learning and writing code.
The focus of our workshop is people who are new to programming, so complete beginners are welcome!

### Prequisites

- A reasonably up-to-date laptop running Windows or OS X
- A power cord
- A little patience
- A little curiosity

### Food & Drinks

We'll have dinner and beverages on Friday night, and breakfast, lunch, and snacks on Saturday. If you have any dietary restrictions, please note these when you register for the workshop.

### Afterparty

Plan on grabbing drinks with us after the workshop on Saturday. The first round is on us!
Location TBD.
