ClojureBridge is a beginner-friendly Clojure programming workshop for women.

This will be a beginner level workshop, and no prior programming experience is required. If you are already comfortable programming in another language apart from Clojure, you may find the class moves too slowly. Ask us about being a teaching assistant!

6:30pm - 9:00pm Friday InstallFest
9:00am - 5:00pm Saturday Workshop

Dinner will be provided Friday. Breakfast and lunch will be provided Saturday.

ClojureBridge is dedicated to increasing diversity in the Clojure community. Men are welcome as the guest of a woman who would like to attend. ClojureBridge is emphatically queer and trans friendly.
