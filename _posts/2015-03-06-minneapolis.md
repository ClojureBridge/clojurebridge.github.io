ClojureBridge is free, beginner-friendly Clojure programming workshops for women.

In this workshop, we'll take you through building a sample app using Clojure. We'll meet up Friday night to install all of the software you need, and then spend Saturday learning and writing code. Each participant needs to bring her or his own computer with fairly recent Mac, Linux or Windows installation. If you have questions about your hardware, email one of the organizers before the event!

When you RSVP you'll be asked a few questions about your operating system, level and type of programming experience.

Sometimes people ask if the Friday night Installfest is mandatory, and yes, it is! It's a crucial part of the weekend, even if you’ve already gone through the instructions independently. There are a ton of moving parts when setting up a development environment, and the reason that we’re able to get through the curriculum on Saturday is that every single student has had their dev environment checked and has been awarded a sticker for their successes.

If you have questions or ideas for us, the best way to get in touch is to email or tweet at the organizers.

Food & Drinks We'll have dinner and beverages on Friday evening, and breakfast, lunch, and snacks on Saturday. If you have any dietary restrictions, please note these when you register for the workshop.
