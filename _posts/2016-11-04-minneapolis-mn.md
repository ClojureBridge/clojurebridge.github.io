ClojureBridge aims to increase diversity within the Clojure community by offering free, beginner-friendly Clojure programming workshops for underrepresented groups in tech.

#### Who Should Attend?

ClojureBridge is open to women and all trans*, genderqueer, and gender non-conforming people that are interested in learning about computer programming. For software developers that are new to the Clojure language we offer a Track 2 to dive right in to functional programming and concurrency.

#### Details

In Track 1 we'll take you through building a sample application using Clojure. At the end of the workshop your application will be live on the Internet!

In Track 2 we'll cover basic syntax and data structures and discuss functional programming and concurrency concepts.

We'll meet up Friday night to install all of the software you need on your laptop, and then spend Saturday learning and writing code.

Each participant needs to bring her own computer with fairly recent Mac, Linux or Windows installation. (If you have a Mac please ensure you are running Mac OS X 10.8 Mountain Lion or a more recent version). If you have questions about your hardware, email one of the organizers before the event!

When you RSVP you'll be asked a few questions about your operating system, level and type of programming experience.

Sometimes people ask if the Friday night Installfest (11/4) is mandatory... We highly recommend that you attend so that all the details of setting up your laptop are done and ready for you to start learning on Saturday morning. If you like you can even get a head start by following our InstallFest Instructions beforehand.

If you have questions or ideas for us, the best way to get in touch is to email or tweet at the organizers.

#### Food & Drinks

We'll have dinner and beverages on Friday evening, and breakfast and lunch on Saturday. If you have any dietary restrictions, please note these when you register for the workshop.
