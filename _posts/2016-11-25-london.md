ClojureBridge London aims to further increase diversity within the Clojure community by offering free, beginner-friendly Clojure programming workshops for under-represented groups in technology. Priority is given to those who identify as women, trans-gener or non-binary gender. Males may register as a guest of one of these participants.

The workshop material supports those with little or no programming experience and introduces them to programming concepts. We organise attendees into small groups with at least one teacher and one assistant.


Event Schedule<br/>

* 25th November
6.30pm - 9pm - a general introduction to Clojure with demo's and experience reports, followed by an install party to setup your laptop for the workshop.

* 26th November
10am - 5pm - hands-on workhop in which you are guided through the Clojure concepts and solving coding exercises.


Its essential to attend the evening session on the 25th November if you wish to attend the workshop the next day. This avoids delays to getting started with the workshop.


Food and drinks will be provided throughout the event, so please let us know if you have any special requirements when you register.
