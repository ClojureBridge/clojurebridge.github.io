**Venue**<br/>
Klarna AB<br/>
Sveavägen 46<br/>
<br/>

ClojureBridge is a free 1-day workshop aimed at increasing the participation of women in the Clojure community. It will be held in Stockholm, on Saturday May 6th, 2017 with an install fest on Friday May 5th, 2017 in the evening. The workshop is intended both for those new to programming, as well as those with some programming experience who would like to explore programming using Clojure, a modern functional programming language. If you have a lot of programming experience, you may find the pace a bit slow; consider joining us as a coach! :)

The workshop will introduce you to fundamental programming concepts and approaches. Participants will fill out a quick survey to help us create groups based on prior knowledge and understanding. Although participants can install the required software for the workshop on their own, it is recommended everyone attend on Friday to set up her programming environment. Saturday will be spent learning and practising Clojure programming. You will be working in small groups of around 3 attendees each. Each participant needs to bring a laptop computer with a fairly recent operating system (Mac, Linux or Windows). If you have questions about your hardware or you don’t have a laptop, please don’t hesitate to send an email to the organisers before the event.

The workshop will be held in English, but we will have a few Swedish speakers on hand, as well.

### Who can attend?

The workshop is open to all women, trans*, and gender nonconforming people.

### Code of Conduct:

The workshop provides a safe and welcoming environment for everyone, so we will be asking all learners and event volunteers to respect our Code of Conduct ( http://bridgefoundry.org/code-of-conduct/ ), which will be strictly enforced. Our aim is that ClojureBridge Stockholm will introduce learners to new possibilities in programming and grow the tech community into a more diverse and interesting group.
