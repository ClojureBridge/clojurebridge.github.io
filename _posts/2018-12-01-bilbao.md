ClojureBridge aims to increase diversity within the Clojure community by offering free, beginner-friendly Clojure programming workshops for underrepresented groups in tech.

#### Who Should Attend?

ClojureBridge is open to women and all trans*, genderqueer, and gender non-conforming people that are interested in learning about computer programming.

#### Details

We'll support help to get ready for the event online and schedule an online call for friday to answer questions, and then spend Saturday learning and writing code. We will adapt the level to those assisting to the event.

Each participant ideally needs to bring her own computer with fairly recent Mac, Linux or Windows installation. (If you have a Mac please ensure you are running Mac OS X 10.8 Mountain Lion or a more recent version). If you have questions about your hardware, email one of the organizers before the event!

When you RSVP you'll be asked a few questions about your operating system, level and type of programming experience.

If you have questions or ideas for us, the best way to get in touch is to email or tweet at the organizers.

#### Food & Drinks

We'll have breakfast and lunch on Saturday. If you have any dietary restrictions, please note these when you register for the workshop.
