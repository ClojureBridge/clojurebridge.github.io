### Description
ClojureBridge is a beginner-friendly Clojure programming workshop for women.

You’ll learn fundamental programming concepts in Clojure through practical examples and exercises. Teachers and assistants are there to guide you and help you build your first apps in Clojure.

The workshop is open to people who are completely new to programming, through to existing developers new to Clojure. We organize attendees into small groups with at least one teacher and one assistant.

Attendees must RSVP through the Meetup event page, as spaces are limited. ClojureBridge is dedicated to increasing diversity in the Clojure community, men are welcome as the guest of a woman who would like to attend. ClojureBridge is emphatically queer and trans-friendly.

### Additional Info
Event Schedule

Friday 29 March, 6.30pm - 8pm: An overview of Clojure, demos and support setting up a Clojure development environment on your laptop.

Saturday 30 March, 10.30am - 5:30pm: we’ll work through the Clojure concepts and carry out coding exercises in small groups.

It is essential to attend the Friday evening session if you wish to attend the workshop the next day. This prevents delays for other attendees during the workshop.

The content for the workshop will be derived from past workshops that some of us have experience running:
