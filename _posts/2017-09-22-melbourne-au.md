#### Purpose

This workshop is for people interested in learning to program with Clojure, an expressive, general-purpose programming language.

#### Background/Audience

ClojureBridge was started to increase diversity in the Clojure community. ClojureBridge is for people who belong to under-represented groups such as women, trans*, genderqueer, or gender non-conforming.

People who identify as men are welcome to come and learn so long as they are guests of an attendee who does not identify as a man.

#### Prerequisites

This is an introductory workshop, available to both complete programming beginners and those with experience in languages other than Clojure!  We'll have enough helpers on hand to keep you challenged throughout the day.

This workshop introduces data structures and functions, and provides opportunities to use them to create programs.  We'll meet up on Friday to install all of the software you need, then spend Saturday learning and writing Clojure code.

Schedule

* InstallFest: Friday, September 22, 6:00pm–9:00pm
* Workshop: Saturday, September 23, 10:00am–5:00pm

The InstallFest on Friday is a time to get some help setting up a working Clojure development environment.

You do not need to be at the whole InstallFest - drop in for an hour any time before 6 PM and 9 PM to get set up!

Please do show up on time on Saturday.
