### Dates
- Friday, November 13th, 6 PM to 8 PM - The Installfest
- Saturday, November 14th, 8 AM to 5 PM - Workshop day

-----
This workshop is for women who are new to Clojure or new to programming.  If you identify as a woman and are interested in learning more, please register and join us. Men are welcome, too! But, if you’re male and would like to attend, you’ll need to find a woman who wants to learn Clojure who will register and bring you along as a guest.

In this workshop, we'll take you through the ClojureBridge curriculum and teach you about Clojure.  A capstone project will get you started making music with Clojure, using the Overtone audio library.  Our experienced TA’s will guide attendees through creating sounds using clojure! We'll meet up Friday night to install all of the software you need, and then spend Saturday learning and writing code.

Total programming novices, system administrators, developers in other languages, and folks who attended our previous workshops are all welcome. We’ll aim to challenge our pro attendees while keeping our newer coders engaged and learning.

(Sometimes people ask if the Friday night installfest is mandatory, and yes, it is! It's a crucial part of the weekend, even if you’ve already gone through the instructions independently. There are a ton of moving parts when setting up a development environment, and the reason that we’re able to get through the curriculum on Saturday is that every single student has had their dev environment checked and has been awarded a sticker for their successes. There are also enough changing parts that even if you’ve been to a workshop in the past, you should attend the Installfest to get re-verified, because this stuff changes almost constantly.)

### Requirements:
Each participant needs to bring her own computer.
### Transportation:
Our venue is located in the heart of Center City Philadelphia.  If you are driving, we recommend you find a garage to park in for Saturday, as that will be the least hassle.  Street parking is available, but is often limited to 2-3 hours at a time.  PromtWorks is walking distance from both Jefferson Station, and the 13th St station of the Market Frankford Line.
### Food:
Dinner will be provided for the Friday installfest.  In addition, a breakfast spread will be provided Saturday morning, with a box lunch provided at noon.  Vegetarian and gluten free options will be available.  If you have any special food requirements, please let us know!
### After party!
After our awesome day learning and programing in such a great language, we’re going to head out for a bite to eat.  There’s a lot of great spots near our venue to hang out and talk about clojure, and diversity in tech (or anything else we think of).  Unfortunately, this outing isn’t sponsored, so keep that in mind while ordering. We hope you can join us!
Please contact the organizer with any questions, or if you have special accommodation needs.
