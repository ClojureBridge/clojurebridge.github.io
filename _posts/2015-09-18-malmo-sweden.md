ClojureBridge aims to increase diversity within the programming community by offering free, beginner-friendly programming workshops for women.

This ClojureBridge workshop will be held in Malmö, Sweden and is intended for those with none or some programming experience. We will use [Clojure](http://clojure.org/), a modern programming language running on the Java virtual machine, to introduce you to fundamental programming concepts. You will learn and practice in small groups of 2 to 4 attendees each. To register, you must identify as a woman. Men, you are welcome to come if you find a woman who wants to learn programming, and who will register and bring you as a guest.

In this workshop, we'll take you through building a sample app using Clojure. We'll meet up Friday night at Jayway's office in Malmö to install all of the software you need. Then we will spend Saturday, also at Jayway, learning and writing code. There will be dinner provided at the Friday installfest, as well as breakfast, lunch and dinner provided at the Saturday workshop. You are welcome to stay for drinks after the workshop on Saturday evening.

Each participant needs to bring their own computer with a fairly recent Mac, Linux or Windows installation. If you have questions about your hardware, email one of the organizers before the event! The workshop will be held in Swedish.

Here's a quote from one previous attendee:

> Many thanks for a very inspiring weekend. And generous! You were so many teachers,
> all the food and drinks, and all the free material you gave us. I'm so glad I came to the workshop!

Our main sponsor [Jayway](http://www.jayway.com/) provides the venue, food, drinks, as well as everything we need for the after work(shop) party. We also have other very generous sponsors. All attendees will receive a free ebook version of Carin Meier's [Living Clojure from O'Reilly](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920034292.do). All attendees will also receive free high-quality [Clojure instruction videos from LispCast](http://www.purelyfunctional.tv/).
