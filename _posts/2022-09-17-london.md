### Description

ClojureBridge is a free, beginner-friendly workshop teaching the Clojure programming language, primarily for trans/cis women and non-binary people. ClojureBridge is emphatically queer and trans\* friendly.

Youâ€™ll learn fundamental programming concepts in Clojure through practical examples and exercises. Teachers and assistants are there to guide you and help you build your first apps in Clojure.

The workshop is open to people who are completely new to programming, through to existing developers new to Clojure. We organise attendees into small groups with at least one teacher and one assistant.

Priority is given to those who identify as trans or cis women and/or non-binary. Men may register as a guest of one of these participants.
